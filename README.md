# tungsten-groovy
This is a Groovy-language companion to the [tungsten-types](https://github.com/lionmage/tungsten-types) project.
While basic support is present in tungsten-types for features such as Groovy operator overloading,
this project contains supplementary tools such as Groovy categories and sample scripts.
